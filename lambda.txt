lambda

we can do automaction and we want to run serverless application we can do it.

if we can to start or stop any instance at a particular tim and we need to take backup at particular time then we use lambda.

drawback is someone need to push that code manually or by using cloud watch

steps
1. create ec2 instrance-> open 80 and 22 ports
2. create iam role->roles->create role-> click on lambda->permissions->do not select any       policy just empty policy->create role.
3. select the created role-> attach policy or add inline policy-> in json section add the      developer developed json code-> review policy->give relevent name and create policy.
4. go to lambda->create function->give name->select the code which developed developed-         >click on change default execution role->use existing role->create function-> remove       default code->copy stop ec2 instance code->give region and instance id in the same code-     >click on deploy-> search for basic settings and click on edit-> edit timeout to 10s-      >savenow scroll up and click on test _ give name and create->click again on test-> but       here we are clicking manually so we can automate it by using cloud watch (we have events    and service using cronjob)
5. click on cloud watch->click on events->get started-> schedule and select cron    expressions->add target-> select our function->create rule.

backup of volumes using lambda

1. create iam role->roles->create role-> click on lambda->permissions->do not select any       policy just empty policy->create role.

2. select the created role-> attach policy or add inline policy-> in json section add the      developer developed json code for automation-> review policy->give relevent name and create policy.

3. create ec2 instce and later launching go to tags->manage tags-> add tag-> key: backup, value: yes->now any instance that have these tags and all the instces with same tag will be backed up.

4. go to lambda-> created function-> give name-> select language-> select existing role->remove default code and paste code developed by our developed
